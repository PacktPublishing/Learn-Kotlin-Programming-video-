## About the Video Course
Kotlin is a statically typed language whose syntax is more expressive and concise. Kotlin has been adopted by Google as a first-class language for developing Android apps. Since then, Kotlin has gained a huge popularity worldwide among developers due to its highly appreciable features, which we will cover in this course.

The course starts by showing you how to set up the Kotlin environment and install Intellij IDEA to write Kotlin code. After that, the course dives into the Kotlin basics and fundamentals such as variables, data types, string templates, expressions, null values, and loops. Moving on, you’ll learn how to write functions in Kotlin. You’ll explore Kotlin as an Object-Oriented Language by exploring interfaces and various Kotlin classes . Next you’ll dive into Functional programming in Kotlin using Lambdas and higher-order functions . Finally, you’ll explore the collection framework and perform operations such as filtering and sorting using Predicates and FlatMaps in Kotlin. 

By the end of the course, you’ll be able to build your own robust program in Kotlin.
